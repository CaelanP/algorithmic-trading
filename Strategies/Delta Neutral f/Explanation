The delta of an option is the difference in the price change and the option price change. You can buy/sell a call or a put at different strike prices, with each different strike price providing different delta values. When you put two (or more) delta values together, they add/subtract.
The idea of this strategy is to determine the general volatility of a stock over a set period of time, find a call and a put with net delta values of less than 5 and buy them both. 
As the price increases, the value of the call increases and the put decreases, as the price decreases, the value of the put increases and the call decreases. It is ideal that the strike price is around the same for both the call and the put, so that the value of each increases and decreases from the same reference point.
Delta neutral is when the delta of a trade is in theory 0 but in practicality around 0. If you have a call with a delta of 0.5 and a put with a delta of -0.5, then the trade is overall delta neutral.
