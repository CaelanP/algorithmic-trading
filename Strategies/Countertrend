A strategy with a much lower rate of success is betting on the success of a reversal, or in other words, that a bull trend will turn into a bear trend or vice versa.
With the High 1 Low 1 strategy it is betting that these reversals will fail, or that the trend will continue. This strategy is saying that this is not the case, and the trend will reverse.
This strategy will most times fail, or get stopped out. It is realiant on the times where it does reverse, to hold through until the end of it to maximize profits. This strategy focuses on taking full profits off of a reversal, when something actually reverses.
