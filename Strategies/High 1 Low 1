The idea of this strategy is to enter in on a trade based on the current trend. The entry method is to enter on an early pullback with a stop loss at the top of the trend.
As the trend grows, in a bull trend it begins to make higher highs, and lower lows, so we are betting that the market will continue to do that. 
A higher low in a bull trend is the bottom of a pullback. The higher lows indicate that the bulls making money are reducing their risk by lowering their overall position size, since if you bought a share at $10 and the beginning of the trend is at $9, your stop loss is at $9. To start the trade your initial risk is 10%, but if the price of the stock goes up a $1 then your overall risk has effectively doubled (from risking $1 to $2). To reduce your risk you can do a couple of things, sell some of the shares which realizes your profits, or increase your stop loss which has a chance of potentially stopping you out from the larger trend that can take place. 
A high 1 is the first attempt to continue the trend from a pullback; the first bar to get above the high of the previous bar in a pullback. The idea with this is that we believe the first attempt to reverse the trend will fail, since about 80% of reversals fail. This current pullback is an attempt at a reversal, and we believe it will fail.
A low 1 opperates the same as a high 1, except in the opposite direction. You look for low 1s in a bear trend, and it is when the low of the bar goes below the low of the previous bar in a pullback.
