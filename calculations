We want to get the high, low, open, close, volume, time of a stock in any duration of time(minute, hour, day, month). We want the history of the past 30 bars
Duration = duration of time, start with days not including weekends that we are looking at stocks. For instance a duration of 21 days will only yeild 15 trading days (21/7 is 3 weeks, 2 days are weekend, leaves 15 days)
Volume list is just the volume, for the amount of days dictated in duration
Low list is a list with the past duration amount of lows
High list is the same concept as low list, but with the high values
Average Volume = sum(volume list)/duration
Delta = option change in $ / stock change in $
  Requires the value of an option today, minus the value of the same option yesterday divided by the value of a stock today (value it closed at) minus the value it closed at yesterday (value it closed at yesterday)
Float = # of tradable shares available to the public
Short Float = (# of shorted stocks / float) * 100
Short Float Ratio = short float/average volume(30 days or so)
Simple Moving Average = sum(close list)/duration
Volatility = high - low
Volatility % = ((high - low)/close) * 100
20 day high/low =  if min(low list) == today low: true means new low, if max(high list) == today high: true means new high
bull bar = if high >= close > open: true means the bar is a bull bar
bear bar = if low <= close < open: true means the bar is a bear bar
  False in both cases would indicate that it is a doji, or that the bar is an arbitrary bar since the open and close can be the same value
